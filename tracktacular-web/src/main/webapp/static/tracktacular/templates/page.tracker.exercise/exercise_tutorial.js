    		An exercise routine holds all of your workouts. Most people only have one routine at a time, but some {~s}
    		people choose to do different routines at once, such as <i>Cardio</i> and <i>Strength Training</i>. {~s} 
    		To add a routine, click on the <span class="icon-s s-add"></span> <b>Add Routine</b> button to open a dialog. {~s}
        	Required fields are bold and marked with a red asterisk. Once a routine is created, click on the  {~s}
        	<b>View Routine</b> link or the routine name icon to start tracking workouts.  {~s}
    	</p>

    		A workout is a collection of exercises that you complete in one session. To add a workout, {~s}
    		click on the <span class="icon-s s-add"></span> <b>Add Workout</b> button to open a dialog. Workout {~s}
    		names are used to identify which group of exercises they contain. Common names include {~s}
    		<i>Split A</i>, <i>Split B</i>, etc. 
    	</p>
    		
    	<p>
    		Once you've created a workout, the next step is to add exercises. Don't worry, {~s}
    		once you create a complete workout for a day, you can clone it to prevent this setup work in the future. {~s}
    		To add an exercise, click the <b>Add Exercise</b> option from the workout's context menu, found by {~s}
    		clicking the <span class="icon-s s-cog"></span> icon next to the workout. You'll need to choose how to {~s}
    		track your progress for this type of exercise. You can choose any combination of repetitions, weight, {~s}
    		distance, duration, or calories. For example, a <i>Bench Press</i> would track repetitions and {~s}
    		weight, but a <i>Run</i> would track distance, duration, and possibly calories. {~s}
    	</p>
    		
    	<p>
    		The last step is to add entries for each exercise. For an exercise like <i>Running</i>, you might {~s}
    		only have one entry of your total time and duration, but for an exercise like <i>Bench Press</i> {~s}
    		you might have 5 entries each with a varying amount of repetitions or weight. Click the <b>Add Entry</b> {~s}
    		on the exercise's context menu by clicking the <span class="icon-s s-cog"></span> icon next to the exercise. {~s}
    	</p>
    		
    	<p>
    		You can expand and collapse your entire workout by clicking the	<span class="icon-s s-plus"></span> and  {~s}
    		<span class="icon-s s-minus"></span> icons. Collapsing a workout is a great way to indicate that it is complete. {~s}
    		When you are ready to enter your next workout, you can quickly copy an existing workout as a template{~s}
    		by clicking <b>Clone Workout</b> on the workout's context menu. The cloned workout will appear at the top{~s}
    		of the page, and you can click on the actual values of the existing Entries to change them in place.{~s}
    	</p>
    		
    	<p>
    		When you are finished with a routine, you can archive it by clicking on <b>Complete Routine</b> from  {~s}
    		the routine's context menu.
