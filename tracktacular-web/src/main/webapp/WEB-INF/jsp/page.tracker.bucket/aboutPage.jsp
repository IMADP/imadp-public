		A Bucket List is a collection of goals you'd like to accomplish before you 'kick the bucket'. While these are often expensive, 
		outlandish, and fear-inducing, there are no excuses when you have the rest of your life to complete them. Track your items with
		the Bucket List Tracker and cross them off when you complete them.
