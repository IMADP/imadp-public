		The Budgets Tracker helps you manage your finances by categorizing your income and expenses.
		Create multiple budgets to track different areas of your life, and archive them when they're no longer
		needed. Sort your entries into categories for an easy summary of your spending or savings. And all of
		your budget items are encrypted - only share your data if you choose to.
