		Setting short-term and long-term goals is a great motivator for getting things done.
		The Goals Tracker lets you breakdown your goals into objectives, and track your progress through
		elapsed time, objectives completed, or manual progress entry. You can generate timelines
		and even get reminders for upcoming objectives through the goal reports. And all your goals and objectives
		are fully encrypted for peace of mind.
