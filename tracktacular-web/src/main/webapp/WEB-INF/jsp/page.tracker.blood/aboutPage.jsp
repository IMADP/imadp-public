		The Blood Pressure Tracker keeps you on track of your health by measuring your systolic and diastolic 
		blood pressure levels. Find out whether your levels are in healthy ranges, and track your history over time
		to make sure they move towards them. Blood pressure tests are usually infrequent, so don't let them slip
		by again with the help of our automatic reminders.
