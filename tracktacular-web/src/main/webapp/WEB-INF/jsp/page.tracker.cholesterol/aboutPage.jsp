		The Cholesterol Tracker keeps you on track of your health by measuring your LDL, HDL, Total Cholesterol,
		and Triglyceride levels. Find out whether your levels are in healthy ranges, and track your history over time
		to make sure they move towards them. Cholesterol tests are usually infrequent, so don't let them slip
		by again with the help of our automatic reminders.
